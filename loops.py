# This code is using a while loop to print the string "benson" three times. The variable
# `number_of_times` is initialized to 3, and the loop continues to execute as long as
# `number_of_times` is not equal to 0. Inside the loop, the string "benson" is printed and the value
# of `number_of_times` is decremented by 1. This process repeats until `number_of_times` is equal to
# 0, at which point the loop terminates.
number_of_times =3
while number_of_times != 0:
    print("benson")
    number_of_times = number_of_times - 1
